                                about yourself. Where are you from? When did you start as a photographer?</p>
                            <h2><span class="interview-sm">(me)</span> I am 26 years old, and I live in Tenerife, though
                                I lived in Madrid for a while when I was studying photography at the EFTI school.<br />
                                I started using my father's analog camera. He had photo-albums and memories of his youth
                                and that was the trigger. But I officially started when I moved to Madrid in 2013, after
                                breaking up with my couple. I had more time and wanted to distract myself, so I started
                                going out to shoot some photos. At the same time I was studying architecture, and I used
                                to photograph buildings. And after that, I opened an Instagram profile to show what I
                                was doing. That was the motivation I needed to keep doing it.</h2>

                            <p class="question">Are you still studying architecture?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">No, I liked it, but I felt like it wasn't my thing,
                                so I quit. At that
                                time, I went out a lot to take photos and I even worked in Madrid as a
                                wedding photographer. That’s when I started to think that maybe photography
                                was a better option for me. Currently, I am studying animation.</p>

                            <p class="question">Besides photography, you are known by your role of creating content for
                                YouTube. How did you start? Did it come from curiosity or aspiration to
                                achieve something using YouTube?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">Casey Neistat influenced me a lot at that moment. I
                                felt like I wanted
                                to do that. I also discovered Negative Feedback, a YouTuber who was making
                                analog photography videos, and I thought that I could contribute making
                                something different, more entertaining and fun.
                                <br />At that time I had income doing wedding photography, and I took advantage
                                of the fact that I was going on a trip to places like Morocco, Lanzarote,
                                the North Pole ... uploading videos about those trips and about photography.
                                <br />It's something I'm happy about because the audience is growing and excited
                                about the content. For me, is a long-term project, although I receive income,
                                there is not enough still.
                            </p>
                            <p class="question">Do you currently make a living from photography? How do you see
                                yourself,
                                professionally speaking, in the future? Focusing exclusively on photography
                                or doing anything different?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">I don't know if I will be doing only YouTube or both
                                photography and video.
                                I think creating content can help me to learn or other stuff. Besides,
                                the lifestyle I love, it should be something that I could develop anywhere
                                away from home, traveling, surfing…
                                <br />I always wonder if this will get anywhere or not, especially because I'm
                                focusing a lot on analog photography that may have less market. But this
                                is something I will consider in the future, for now, I would like to continue
                                creating content.

                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">In the past, I wouldn’t have minded working as a
                                wedding photographer,
                                in fact, it is something I have done for 2 years. And the future… Maybe
                                I see myself working as a photographer and combining it with content creation.</p>
                            <p class="question">Considering your style it seems that you could be a good fashion
                                photographer
                                or being related to the editorial field.</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">It's not the first time that someone says that, and I
                                like it, but at
                                the same time it freaks me out a little. A few years ago I had a clearer
                                vision of what to do, making a living with traveling photos a living or
                                something documentary related. Maybe I would see myself more as a travel
                                and nature photographer... something more free connected with my lifestyle.
                                I think the world of fashion doesn't seem so appealing to me.</p>

                                wanted to avoid producing anything. Once I could go outside a little, it
                                didn’t affect me much since I live very close to nature. I’ve been able
                                to go out when I wanted, I live near the sea and the mountains. What I
                                currently enjoy the most is making plans to go out into nature because
                                I am on my own and can go without wearing a mask. This year I’ve started
                                to go everywhere by myself, and it makes me happy. I would say that shooting
                                portraits is the part of my work that I can’t do for now.</p>
                            <p class="question">Do you have any inspiration in photography that has been a great
                                influence
                                on you? Do you inspire in from other photographers or do you have other
                                sources?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">There are many, like Todd Hido, Gregory Crewdson...
                                I’ve been very inspired
                                by Martina Matencio (lalovenenoso). On the other hand, I also like what
                                Coke Bartrina is doing, I love his work and encourages me to do something
                                more personal. I'm also passionate about cinema and I save screenshots
                                in my computer of scenes that I like for inspiration. Also a good reference
                                for my work is NOWNESS or IGNANT.</p>

                            <p class="question">You mix landscape and portraits, two very different styles that make you
                                comfortable. But which one you’d say you enjoy the most? and why?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">I like shooting portraits a lot, but it’s true that
                                sometimes it’s a little
                                tricky when I don’t know the person. I find motivation taking photos of
                                people who "tell" me something or want me to take photographs, feeling
                                there is something more. Interesting people and even costumbrist situations,
                                for example, a person working in the studio or making something.</p>
                            <p class="question">What’s your motivation for going out and taking photos? Is it just a
                                visual
                                thing or are there other reasons? What does photography mean to you?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">My main motivation is to generate memories. Lately, I
                                am looking at the
                                photography more as a way of bonding with people, when I love someone or
                                feel something for a person, or even when I enjoy a particular moment.
                                <br />Shooting a photo of a beautiful landscape or a sunset won't make any difference
                                from others, and that’s why I love filming and shooting these things, with
                                a context and some kind of importance. On the other hand, I really enjoy
                                it because you can relax and free yourself for a while.

                            <p class="question">How do you feel creatively speaking? Do you think it's a good moment for
                                your photography? Do you feel that instagram conditioned the way you take
                                photos?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">To be honest, I think I'm a bit stuck now, I keep
                                shooting pictures of
                                things I'm doing, but in a more traditional way.
                                <br />I’m not conditioned when I work, when I see something I'm interested in,
                                I simply take the picture. Maybe it's a bit harder deciding what I'm going
                                to share, or if I like it or not, but I usually end uploading it to Instagram
                                and that's it.

                                projects.
                                Do you still shoot in digital? What do you like most about photographing
                                with analog film?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(LA)">I don’t refuse working in digital. I prefer film for
                                personal projects
                                because you need to focus on them differently and think about the process
                                and that is a very positive thing to consider. Likewise, I like both, digital
                                and film, and at the end of the day I just like to photograph. I love analogue
                                photography process, sensation when shooting, the sound and the surprise
                                with the pictures after developing. It's fun and nice.</p>

                                haven't felt like that
                                in a long time. I've started surfing a lot again and also going out in
                                Tenerife to any corner surrounded by nature.
                                <br />On a professional side, I'm not having the same income as when I was as
                                a wedding photographer in Madrid but, in the other hand, I'm happy because
                                I'm doing what I like for YouTube. I also make videos for Patreon. I wish
                                my situation was better here since working in the Canary Islands it's quite
                                complicated sometimes. In the future, I might return to Madrid, but I really
                                would miss the sea…
                                <br />Now I'm working on a project about Canary Islands landscapes, capturing
                                in some way all those scenes that don’t "exist" because they are multi-exposures.
