                                <p class="question">When did you start as a photographer? did it take a long time to find
                                    your style? or maybe you haven't found it yet?</p>
                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">I picked up my very first DSLR in 2015 and began documenting some city
                                    trips I did with friends back in the days. Since I used to be a DJ until
                                    2018, I brought my camera to some shows and began to snap some photos.
                                    Shortly after, I photographed parties and festivals. In 2017 I started
                                    to meet with friends and strangers to shoot ‚tfp 'shootings. I was lucky
                                    to travel a lot in the past years and to see incredible places and people.</p>

                                class="reply">It took me a lot of time and failure to develop my very own style. I truly
                                    believe photography is an ongoing process that is very much influenced
                                    by your surroundings, mood, everyday circumstances, places you see, and
                                    the people you meet. And ultimately, your style is evolving every day.</p>
                                    <p
                                    class="question">Is it hard to find your style in photography or are you happy with it?
                                        do you spend time thinking about it or you just flow and let the things
                                        happen naturally?</p>
                                        <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">One piece of advice I can give is not to try to ‚fit 'into a specific
                                            niche in photography. I started out photographing what I'm interested in,
                                            and I'm still doing it. It still brings me the most joy. Photography enables
                                            me to find beauty in the ordinary and the everyday life. If you feel like
                                            shooting with people —shoot portraits. If you feel like shooting nature
                                            —go travel and document it. I think you should follow what you're interested
                                            in the most and don't think you should only stick to one topic.</p>

                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">I started Shooting film one year ago because my favorite photographers
                                    also shoot film. All I wanted was to understand why they're doing it. So
                                    I bought my Leica M6, a fully manual film camera that changed my way of
                                    photographing entirely. It taught me to slow down and to rethink my compositions.
                                    At first, it was super "painful "to spend a lot of money on film, but now
                                    after one year, 95% of the time, I would always pick up my analog camera
                                    for a personal project rather than going digital. It's just way more fun
                                    and the photographs I take mean so much more to me personally.</p>

                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">I'm pretty happy with the results I'm able to achieve with my photography.
                                    When I have an idea or a specific picture in my mind, I can realize it
                                    with the photographs I'm taking. Yes, I feel productive in a sense that
                                    social media enables me to share what I want to share online easily. That
                                    gives me a feeling of working and evolving as a photographer. But there
                                    is definitely a long way to go since photography has so much more to offer.
                                    I want to shoot more editorials in the future and have fewer shootings,
                                    therefore more conceptional ones. As I mentioned before, once I feel comfortable
                                    with what I'm doing, there are always some new inspirations that caught
                                    my attention and make me feel like I still have so much to learn.</p>

                                    <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">My photography focuses on working with people, e.g., portraits, event
                                        documentations, commercial shootings, and weddings. I also meet with Influencers
                                        and shoot little campaigns with them. I also create videos, but my photographs
                                        are way better.</p>

                                <p class="question">Most of your photos have a cinematic vibe, do you find inspiration in
                                    cinema? where else do you usually find inspiration? is there any photographer
                                    you would like to recommend?</p>
                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">I know a lot of my photos look cinematic, I love shooting at night. But
                                    to be honest, I'm not seeking this cinematic look that much. Nowadays,
                                    I prefer a much more natural look. But somehow, the sceneries I'm shooting
                                    have that cinematic feel in themselves, I only press the shutter. I love
                                    watching movies, but I wouldn't consider myself a huge movie fan. I have
                                    my favorite movies and watch them over and over again. Because when I really
                                    like one movie I get lost in it whether it's the story, the music, the
                                    locations, everything can trigger my attention.</p>
                                <p class="reply">My favorite photographers are definitely Joe Greer and André Wagner (both
                                    street photographers from the US). I just love their candid way of capturing
                                    life in such a beautiful way. Since photographing strangers in the street
                                    is very difficult in Germany (due to the law regulations we have), I don't
                                    shoot as much street photography as I would love to.</p>

                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(TH)">This is by far the photograph I remember the most. I took this photo right
                                    at the opera in Paris in October 2019. There was this girl with her yellow
                                    dress standing right next to me. I wanted to photograph her but didn't
                                    know when the best timing would be. I focused so much on acting natural
                                    and waiting for the right time to take the shot that I totally missed the
                                    point that a lot of strangers started to cross the street. Then, out of
                                    a sudden, the girl's boyfriend appeared, grabbed her by the face, and gave
                                    her that kiss. I was shocked and excited at the same time and took one
                                    single shot from the hip. My heart began to beat faster, and I walked away.
                                    I couldn't look at my camera for almost 10 minutes since I still felt so
                                    overwhelmed by the whole situation. Then after sitting down on a bench,
                                    I looked at my camera. And I've nailed it.</p>
                                <p class="question">You said in your bio <em>"photography changed my entire life"</em>. Would
                                    you like to explain it in more depth and tell us how do you see the photography
                                    nowadays? do you feel that you have the same enthusiasm and that kind of
                                    naive fascination similar to a child discovering something new?</p>

                                data-interview="(TH)">I don't feel like a child when I'm out photographing since it became my
                                    job and profession. But I'm taking my camera everywhere I go because having
                                    my camera by my side enables me to look at life in a different and more
                                    meaningful way. It didn't change my life because I can make a living from
                                    it, but looking through my camera and taking photographs is my way of expressing
                                    everything I see and feel in an aesthetically pleasing and human way.</p>

                                    lot of inspiration from it because it's able to change my entire mood in
                                    seconds. I also love working out and getting new inspiration by talking
                                    to like-minded people. I love talking about mindset and productivity and

                                    photography for more than five years now, I think I made some experiences
                                    worth sharing and talking about. I try to upload a new video every now
                                    and then, but I definitely want to make YouTube a way to give my community
