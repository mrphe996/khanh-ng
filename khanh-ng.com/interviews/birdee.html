                                 <h2><span class="interview-sm">(BIRDEE)</span> I grew up in Hanoi and was always creative in some way. When I was in middle school and high school I devoted most of my time to playing music in band, taking a random art class here and there. I remember I took a photography class in high school where we learned to use the dark room and I loved it. Despite my love for creating, growing up with middle class working parents as well as a love for science,  when it was time to pick my major in college I ended up choosing to get a degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography. I remember being quite excited I found something that was visual and scientific combined. I’ve now been doing Ultrasound for 15 years, and it’s been a great career. It wasn’t until recently (this past year)  that I've taken the plunge to become a full time photographer.</h2>

                                class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">When I was in my mid to late 20’s I was starting to realize I had become
                                    disconnected from myself. The realization was not immediate. It was through
                                    trials, conflicts, and a failing marriage that I started to see that I
                                    didn’t know how to listen to my intuition and trust it. This inevitably
                                    led me to find an outlet for myself which came to me in the form of taking
                                    self portraits. Looking back on it, it was a beautiful way to start reconnecting
                                    with myself as well as focus on a creative outlet again. I started to share
                                    myself portraits on Instagram in 2014, where I began to connect with other
                                    artists, and others that just wanted to express themselves deeply through
                                    imagery and not feel alone in that. I made several friends through the
                                    Instagram community who encouraged me to continue with this hobby of sort,
                                    this search and discovery of self. Over the past several years I started
                                    doing shoots for other people, and the feeling of being able to reflect
                                    back others beauty had me ready to do this full time.</p>
                                    <p class="question">How were your very first years in photography? Did you have any idea of
                                        the topics or the things you wanted to shoot? How long it took you to get
                                        your current style?</p>
                                    <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">I had no idea that myself portraits would turn into something bigger.
                                        I went about it without any limitations, goals, constructs, rules, or expectations
                                        for myself. I was purely creating for the enjoyment of creating, expressing,
                                        and learning more about myself. I think because of this freedom, as well
                                        as the excitement of something new, I created so much work in the first
                                        couple years. It wasn’t until I had created a good amount of work that
                                        I could look back on it and see my style.</p>

                                <p class="question">You have a very sensitive and beautiful taste focusing your photographs
                                    in femininity. How do you see women in photography? As a woman, have you
                                    ever struggle with making your career in photography?</p>
                                <p class="reply"
                                data-interview="(BD)">Thank you so much. I have never been deliberate with my focus or style
                                    in photography, it’s all come very natural to me. I believe it’s been a
                                    beautiful expression of the subconscious, and another way that I'm learning
                                    more about myself every day. I think because I found photography as a form
                                    of self discovery, appreciating my own sensuality and bravery, that I also
                                    naturally see that and celebrate it in others.</p>
                                <p class="reply">So far in my experience with being behind the lens, I have found that
                                    the only thing holding me back in a career with photography has been my
                                    own self limiting beliefs, which I am working on daily.</p>
                                <p class="question">What kind of clients do you have? You have a very personal style: How
                                    does this fit with commercial works?</p>
                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">My clients are individuals who hire me for these immersive shoots. Their
                                    reasons vary from going through a transition in life, moving, overcoming
                                    a tragedy, healing, achieving and celebrating something, or to simply just
                                    wanting to feel beautiful and make art. The shoot is typically an entire
                                    day and allows time for them to explore these feelings and express them
                                    in their own way. The session is also a time set aside for feminine playtime,
                                    which feels celebratory, ceremonial, and freeing in itself.
                                    <br/>I have yet to do commercial work, but this is something that I’m interested
                                    in exploring more in the future.</p>

                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">I do always shoot both! I love them both for their own reasons. When I’m
                                    doing a shoot above water, I would typically only end up using my film
                                    images. But for the underwater shoots, in order to capture those precise
                                    moments that are magic and because the subject is almost always moving,
                                    I end up taking hundreds of photos for just one shoot. Digital is just
                                    so much more practical for this reason. I still can't help but to take
                                    a few rolls of film underwater each time as well.</p>

                                    significant others wanted me to stop taking self portraits and sharing
                                    them. Maybe this wouldn't be considered a creative crisis, but it was a
                                    crisis in a way that I had to really take a step back and evaluate what
                                    was important to me, and what did I want to be saying with my photography.
                                    It was beyond frustrating at the time, but I look back on it and am glad
                                    I was forced to question my actions and intentions. It allowed me to find
                                    my voice, find more confidence in it, and move forward with more intention.</p>

                                    for me the meaning of an image is revealed not in any planning, but in
                                    reflection, sometimes years after the image is made. The key for me is
                                    to connect with my inner self and be honest and open hearted during the
