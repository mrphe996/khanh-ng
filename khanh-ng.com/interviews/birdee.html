                                did you grow up and when did you realize you wanted to be a photographer?</p>
                            <h2><span class="interview-sm">(BIRDEE)</span> I grew up in Hanoi and was always creative in
                                some way. When I was in middle school and high school I devoted most of my time to
                                playing music in band, taking a random art class here and there. I remember I took a
                                photography class in high school where we learned to use the dark room and I loved it.
                                Despite my love for creating, growing up with middle class working parents as well as a
                                love for science, when it was time to pick my major in college I ended up choosing to
                                get a degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography. I remember being quite excited I found
                                something that was visual and scientific combined. I’ve now been doing Ultrasound for 15
                                years, and it’s been a great career. It wasn’t until recently (this past year) that I've
                                taken the plunge to become a full time photographer.</h2>

                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">When I was in my mid to late 20’s I was starting to
                                realize I had become
                                disconnected from myself. The realization was not immediate. It was through
                                trials, conflicts, and a failing marriage that I started to see that I
                                didn’t know how to listen to my intuition and trust it. This inevitably
                                led me to find an outlet for myself which came to me in the form of taking
                                self portraits. Looking back on it, it was a beautiful way to start reconnecting
                                with myself as well as focus on a creative outlet again. I started to share
                                myself portraits on Instagram in 2014, where I began to connect with other
                                artists, and others that just wanted to express themselves deeply through
                                imagery and not feel alone in that. I made several friends through the
                                Instagram community who encouraged me to continue with this hobby of sort,
                                this search and discovery of self. Over the past several years I started
                                doing shoots for other people, and the feeling of being able to reflect
                                back others beauty had me ready to do this full time.</p>
                            <p class="question">How were your very first years in photography? Did you have any idea of
                                the topics or the things you wanted to shoot? How long it took you to get
                                your current style?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">I had no idea that myself portraits would turn into
                                something bigger.
                                I went about it without any limitations, goals, constructs, rules, or expectations
                                for myself. I was purely creating for the enjoyment of creating, expressing,
                                and learning more about myself. I think because of this freedom, as well
                                as the excitement of something new, I created so much work in the first
                                couple years. It wasn’t until I had created a good amount of work that
                                I could look back on it and see my style.</p>

                            <p class="question">You have a very sensitive and beautiful taste focusing your photographs
                                in femininity. How do you see women in photography? As a woman, have you
                                ever struggle with making your career in photography?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">Thank you so much. I have never been deliberate with
                                my focus or style
                                in photography, it’s all come very natural to me. I believe it’s been a
                                beautiful expression of the subconscious, and another way that I'm learning
                                more about myself every day. I think because I found photography as a form
                                of self discovery, appreciating my own sensuality and bravery, that I also
                                naturally see that and celebrate it in others.</p>
                            <p class="reply">So far in my experience with being behind the lens, I have found that
                                the only thing holding me back in a career with photography has been my
                                own self limiting beliefs, which I am working on daily.</p>
                            <p class="question">What kind of clients do you have? You have a very personal style: How
                                does this fit with commercial works?</p>
                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">My clients are individuals who hire me for these
                                immersive shoots. Their
                                reasons vary from going through a transition in life, moving, overcoming
                                a tragedy, healing, achieving and celebrating something, or to simply just
                                wanting to feel beautiful and make art. The shoot is typically an entire
                                day and allows time for them to explore these feelings and express them
                                in their own way. The session is also a time set aside for feminine playtime,
                                which feels celebratory, ceremonial, and freeing in itself.
                                <br />I have yet to do commercial work, but this is something that I’m interested
                                in exploring more in the future.

                                moments that are magic and because the subject is almost always moving,
                                I end up taking hundreds of photos for just one shoot. Digital is just
                                so much more practical for this reason. I still can't help but to take
                                a few rolls of film underwater each time as well.</p>

                                witness and share it
                                with others. When I’m able to show a client how beautiful, creative, playful,
                                and strong they are, they are able to see themselves in a whole new way.

                            <p class="reply" data-interview="(BD)">Early on in my photography journey, I had a couple
                                instances where my
                                significant others wanted me to stop taking self portraits and sharing
                                them. Maybe this wouldn't be considered a creative crisis, but it was a
                                crisis in a way that I had to really take a step back and evaluate what
                                was important to me, and what did I want to be saying with my photography.
                                It was beyond frustrating at the time, but I look back on it and am glad
                                I was forced to question my actions and intentions. It allowed me to find
                                my voice, find more confidence in it, and move forward with more intention.</p>

                                it conveys the inner
                                world that I was exploring, discovering, and nurturing. A lot of times
                                for me the meaning of an image is revealed not in any planning, but in
                                reflection, sometimes years after the image is made. The key for me is
                                to connect with my inner self and be honest and open hearted during the
                                creating process.</p>

                                they are new. I have found that when I move through something that terrifies
                                me, it helps me grow in so many ways I wouldn’t have known possible. I
                                feel so passionate about making art and sharing beauty. So, in other words,
