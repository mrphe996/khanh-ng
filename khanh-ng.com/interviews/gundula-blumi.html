Hi nghia, thanks for taking
                                    the time to make this interview. It's been difficult to find information
                                    about you, what could tou tell us about yourself?</p>
                                 <h2><span class="interview-sm">(me)</span> Hi, thank you very much for this interview! I am 34 years old and have been living in Berlin in Germany since I was 20. I grew up on the North Sea coast in a small town. I like life in the big city, but I visit my home country regularly because I love the minimalist landscape of the Wadden Sea and need the space in which my eyes and mind can relax again. My pictures are mostly created when I drive out of Berlin, in nature. I came to Berlin to study. I then worked with mentally handicapped people for many years. I am fascinated by the fact that every single person in the world lives in their very own reality, the more special or strange a reality appears, the more interesting I find it.</h2>

                                    Do you feel it’s a way to express yourself that would be harder otherwise?</p>

                                class="reply" data-interview="(GB)">I started taking photos as a child, and I have always been fascinated
                                    by being able to depict the things and people in my life on paper. My family
                                    has always photographed a lot, that's why I grew up with it and was allowed
                                    to borrow my mother's analogue camera at the beginning, but soon got my
                                    own, with which I then photographed everything that seemed important to
                                    me. The goal of my photography was and still is to capture memories. I
                                    have a memory cabinet with pictures from my life and at some point I want
                                    to be 90 years old and look at these pictures. I'm looking forward to it.
                                    Then at some point I discovered experimental artistic photography, which
                                    has become my passion. And yes, it is definitely a channel for me to express
                                    myself. In addition, photography is my compensation for the often overstimulated
                                    everyday life. When I take photos or edit pictures, then I am completely
                                    with myself and in my world and my inner being, which has gotten mixed
                                    up in everyday life, comes back into place.</p>

                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(GB)">I have an income from photography, but I also have another job in the
                                    social field that is very important to me, because photography and art
                                    have to stay independent for me. I believe that if my existence were to
                                    depend on my art, then I would no longer enjoy it. Photography is something
                                    I want to be completely free in.</p>
                                <!--<p class="question">With that personal style, I sometimes wonder how difficult it is being in the photography profession. Do you think it is complicated working in photography with such an intimate and personal style?</p>
                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(GB)">Oh, that's a tough question. I think intimacy is what makes you interesting, but I think you have to be flexible if you want to make a living in photography. I'm not flexible; I always do what feels right.</p>     -->

                                <p class="question">You usually shoot in film. How is your process and style? Do you pay a
                                    lot of attention to the technique, composition and result? Do you scan
                                    the negatives or develop the film yourself?</p>
                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(GB)">At the moment I'm even rediscovering digital photography, I like the minimalist
                                    and sterile of digital photography. But I love the warm and real thing
                                    about analogue photography, the pictures somehow seem to be “heavier” and
                                    “more valuable”, more sustainable, digital pictures fly away faster. I
                                    developed my pictures myself for a while and found it really exciting,
                                    but lately I've been having them developed again and then I scan the result
                                    myself. Over the years I have developed various techniques that I combine
                                    and develop further over and over again. Sometimes a technique works for
                                    a while and then suddenly it doesn't work anymore - because its time is
                                    simply over. Then something new will come. I just try around a lot and
                                    the most beautiful results are the results that surprise me, because I
                                    wasn't expecting them.</p>
                                <p class="question">Your pictures are abstract, nostalgic and dark, even like a dream between
                                    reality and surreal. as a David Lynch fan your work reminds me of him,
                                    and his filming style, and what he said:  <em>I would love to be in that state of a waking dream all day long, but you have to have some quiet. The world is getting louder every year, but to sit and dream is a beautiful thing.</em>
                                    <br/>Do you feel identified with that in your work?</p>
                                <p class="reply" data-interview="(GB)">Yes, sometimes I just wish to be able to immerse myself in my pictures
                                    and to blur with them. Maybe that happens when I die that I can choose
                                    a picture in which I then disappear and become blurred with the aura of
                                    the picture. And yes, the world often overstimulates me and I need a lot
                                    of time to regenerate and diving into images is one method for me to draw
                                    new strength. After exhausting days I just sit there for hours and look
                                    at pictures by different photographers, which then trigger something in
                                    me and let me come down. I love to plunge into life, but what I have experienced
                                    only gets value for me when I have enough time to process it. And for that
                                    I also need time and rest and being alone. Keeping the balance between
                                    experiencing and processing is not easy.</p>
